                    Upon jinxing the last of five people necessary, the user is notified that they now have access to the lottery and able to win the amount in the prize pool. They are notified about the current prize pool, as well as how much the prize pool has increased over the last week from deposits of other participants who failed to complete the challenge in time. The user is reminded about the ending date of the challenge and that getting jinxed again and completing additional tasks would increase their chance to win.
