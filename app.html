                    A person becomes jinxed first by installing the app and then either by meeting someone who has completed the challenge, or being one of the first 100 randomly selected people at the start of a challenge. They recieve a notification that they have been challenged, and the option to accept or decline the challenge. They are given information about the name of the challenge, its sponsor, the current prize pool and time remaining until the challenge is over. They are notified that their commitment fee will be locked in until they have completed the challenge.

                    Once accepted, they will be asked to confirm that they understand that their commitment fee will be locked until they have completed a task, and that it will be lost and added to the prize pool if the task should not be completed in time. They are also given the deadline for the tasks (all of which have the same deadline). Once confirmed, they are given three different tasks to choose from.

The user is reminded that this is done by being in proximity of others who have installed the app. The user is also notified that his deposit has been unlocked.

                    Upon jinxing the last of five people necessary, the user is notified that they are now in the lottery and able to win the amount in the prize pool. They are notified about the current prize pool, as well as how much the prize pool has increased over the last week from deposits of other participants who failed to complete the challenge in time. The user is reminded about the ending date of the challenge and that getting jinxed again and completing additional tasks would increase their chance to win.
