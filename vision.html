                    <h3>The Climate Challenge
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        It is well known that the world is up for a huge task considering 
                        climate change (1). The UN´s sustainable development goal number 13 
                        is dedicated solemnly to this topic because there will be “catastrophic 
                        consequences” if we´re not able to limit the global carbon emissions. 
                        The rich part of the world is responsible for around two thirds of the 
                        global climate emissions (2). A wealthy country like Norway has made 
                        huge profit from these emissions, but it has been at a large cost for
                         our planet.</p>

                    <h3>
                        Engaging locally and globally
                    </h3>
                     <p>
                        Obviously, it can be quite overwhelming for the everyday person to try 
                        and cope with all of this. Our vision when making JINX, was to make it 
                        easy for people to engage on both a global and local level. The user 
                        contributes globally by making sure that a huge amount of money finds its
                         way straight to an ideal organization. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        Looking forward
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        With JINX, we want to transform the complex and – often quite overwhelming 
                        topic of climate change – into something concrete and entertaining for the 
                        individuals. We strongly believe there is hope. More and more voters have 
                        chosen political parties with a green profile in the recent elections, 
                        especially amongst the younger population (). That show us that there exists
                         a willingness to fight the climate problem we´re living with today.
