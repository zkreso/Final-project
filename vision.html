            <h2>The Climate Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                It is well known that the world has a huge task up ahead when it comes to 
                climate change. The UN´s sustainable development goal number 13 
                is dedicated solemnly to this topic because there will be "catastrophic 
                consequences" if we are not able to limit global carbon emissions<sup>1</sup>. 
                <br><br>
                The rich part of the world is responsible for around two thirds of 
                global climate emissions<sup>4</sup>. A wealthy country like Norway has profited 
                vastly from activities that have contributed to these emissions, and which have come at a large cost to
                our planet.
                <br><br>
                It is crucial to act now if the world is to reach the 
                goals from the Paris Agreement, in particular the goal of preventing a temperature
                rise of more than 1.5 - 2 degrees Celcius above pre-industrial levels <sup>5, 6</sup>. 
                <br><br>
                There are severeal consequences following climate change in the quite near future. 
                The rising temperature leads to polar ice caps melting and ocean acidification. The world 
                also has to face more extreme weather. The UN is determined to fight global warming by the fact that there
                will be more conflicts, economic inequality, health issues and refugees in 
                the world caused by climate change <sup>4</sup>. Hunger is again on the rise, with 
                issues caused by climate extremes like droughts in some parts of the world <sup>2</sup>.
                <br><br>
                For this reason, we believe that it should be in every country, institution and company´s 
                interest to engage in – and to invest in – solutions that strive to cope with the 
                climate crisis in one way or another.

            <h2>Engaging locally and globally</h2>
            <p>
                Obviously, it can be quite overwhelming for the average person to try 
                to deal with all of the mentioned above. One of the subgoals of our chosen UN sustainability goal is to strenghten
                the awareness about climate change and to make individuals and institutions 
                able and motivated to become involved in climate actions.
                <br><br>
                Our vision when making JINX, was to make it 
                easy for people to engage both on a local and a global level. The user becomes easily involved with their local
                surroundings with JINX. Apart from the obvious positives following cleaner and safer immediate surroundings, the awareness
                and engagement in everyday life is just as important.
                <br><br>
                At the same time, the user contributes globally by making 
                sure that a considerable amount of money finds its
                way straight to an ideal organization of their choice. We know that there are enormous amounts of competence
                and engagement amongst all the great climate-oriented organizations that exist today. 
                But they need support, both economically and socially, to grow and to be able to make a difference.

            <h2>Looking forward</h2>
            <p>
                With JINX, we want to transform the complex – and often quite overwhelming –
                topic of climate change, into something manageble and entertaining for 
                individuals.
                <br><br>
                We strongly believe there is hope for the future.
                More and more voters have 
                chosen political parties with a green profile in the recent elections in Europe particularly, 
                especially amongst the younger population <sup>5</sup>. That shows us that there exists
                a willingness to fight the climate problem we are all faced with. We believe it is our
                duty to listen and invest in the future now.
