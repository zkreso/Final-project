    <h1>Some "hamburger menu" concepts without javscript</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="index2.html">Concept 1</a>
            <p>Not really a conventional hamburger menu. It's simply a link to the bottom of the page where the menu has been placed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="index3.html">Concept 2</a>
            <p>
                Uses focused-within css selector to move a full screen div from off screen to on screen when it, or any of its contents have been focused. Not supported by IE and older Edge versions.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="index4.html">Concept 3</a>
            <p>
                Uses target css selector to turn display from none to visible (in this case, flex) when targeted. Close button is empty anchor that is clickable. Works with most browsers, but fills browser history with anchor tags.
