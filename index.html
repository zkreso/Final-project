                            Many people find it difficult to know where to even begin when it comes to fighting our current crisis. <br>
                            What Jinx does is that it transforms this large and difficult problem into something tangible, allowing users to direct their efforts and see the results.
                            <br><br>
                            Through Jinxing other people when someone with the app comes within the proximity of someone else with the app, 
                            the games begin and both friends and family alike might get smitten by the competitive aspect of the game we play to save our planet. <br>

                        <h2> So what exactly is our crisis?</h2>
                        <p>
                        The world is getting warmer and warmer, with 2019 being the second warmest year on record <sup>1</sup>. <br><br>
                        If the warming continues, critical problems like rising sea levels, more frequent extreme
                        weather, droughts that lead to hunger crises and melting polar ice caps will become more and more difficult to deal with <sup>2</sup>. <br><br>
                        And we haven´t even mentioned the pollution of the ocean, all of the different species that are in danger of going extinct or the dangerously high levels of air pollution <sup>3</sup>. <br><br>
                        JINX takes all of this into consideration and makes contributing to the fight against climate change more accessible than ever before. <br><br>
                        JINX makes it easy for everyone to contribute both locally and globally. <br>

                        <h2>So here's how the app works.</h2>
                        <p>
                            People with the app installed have a chance to become jinxed. This gives them the option to complete one of three predetermined tasks that are designed to combat global warming. If they complete a task, as well as pass the baton on to five additional participants by jinxing them, they can win the money in the prize pool.<br><br> 
                            After you've completed one or more tasks, your entry fee will be given back to you and you'll receive one lottery ticket for each task completed.<sup>*</sup>
                            <br><br>
                            <div class="minimized__container"><span class="minimized"> The lottery is held at a seasonal rate, where the size of the pot will vary depending on sponsors and participants. </span></div>
                            <br><br>
                            <!-- The first thousand people to download the app will receive an offer to participate in a challenge. 
                            They will be explained the rules of the game and asked to pay an entry fee of 100 nok.
                            If they were to accept the challenge then they would receive a list of environmental tasks, where they would be required to complete at least one of them within a given timespan in order to win back the entry fee. 
                            These tasks have been put together in collaboration with ideal organizations and range from picking up trash at a beach to joining demonstrations or volunteering for a few hours of work at one of our collaborators' venues.  
                            <br><br>
                            After you've completed one or more tasks, your entry fee will be given back to you and you'll receive one lottery ticket for each task completed.
                            Our sponsors have donated a sum of money that makes up the prize money of the lottery along with the entry fee of those who took on the challenge, but failed to complete their assignment in time. 
                            Before being eligible to participate in the lottery however, there is one final task that must be completed. You must Jinx ten new people who will then get the offer to take on the challenge.
                            Now you decide for yourself whether this is a passive or an active task as you only need to come within proximity of someone else with the app installed to Jinx them.  
                            <br><br>
                            The lottery is held at a seasonal rate, where the size of the pot will vary depending on sponsors and participants. 
                            All winners will get to choose a verified environmental organization from a list provided in the app, to which half of the earnings will go - the rest will be transferred to the user. 
                            This way we ensure that the app provides not only labour for our planet, but also directs money where it counts.
