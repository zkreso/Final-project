                            Many people find it difficult to know where to even begin when it comes to fighting our current crisis. <br>
                            What Jinx does is that it transforms this large and difficult problem into something tangible, allowing users to direct their efforts and see the results.
                            <br><br>
                            Through Jinxing other people when someone with the app comes within the proximity of someone else with the app, 
                            the games begin and both friends and family alike might get smitten by the competitive aspect of the game we play to save our planet.

                        <h2> So what exactly is our crisis?</h2>
                        <p>
                        The world is getting warmer and warmer, with 2019 being the second warmest year on record <sup>1</sup>. <br><br>
                        If the warming continues, critical problems like rising sea levels, more frequent extreme
                        weather, droughts that lead to hunger crises and melting polar ice caps will become more and more difficult to deal with <sup>2</sup>. <br><br>
                        And we haven´t even mentioned the pollution of the ocean, all of the different species that are in danger of going extinct or the dangerously high levels of air pollution <sup>3</sup>. <br><br>
                        JINX takes all of this into consideration and makes contributing to the fight against climate change more accessible than ever before. <br><br>
                        JINX makes it easy for everyone to contribute both locally and globally. <br>

                        <h2>So here's how the app works</h2>
                        <p>
                            When you have installed the app, there is a chance you´ll get Jinxed. You will then be able to perform climate-friendly tasks after paying an entry fee of 100 NOK. <br><br>

                            The tasks have been put together in collaboration with ideal organizations, and range from picking up trash at a beach to joining demonstrations or volunteering for a few hours of work at one of our collaborators´ venues. <br><br>

                            After completing the task within the time limit, you will Jinx five other persons to get access to the lottery. <br><br> 

                            The prize pool consists of money from our sponsors along with the entry fee of those who took on the challenge, but failed to complete their tasks in time. <br><br>

                            All winners will get to choose a verified environmental organization from a list provided in the app, to which half of the earnings will go - the rest will be transferred to the user. <br><br><br>
