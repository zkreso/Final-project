                Many people find it difficult to know where to even begin to help with our current crisis. <br>
                What Jinx does is that it transforms this huge inconceivable problem into something tangible, where users can direct their efforts and see the results.
                <br><br><br>
                Through jinxing other people when someone with the app comes within the proximity of someone else with the app, the games begin and both friends and families alike might get smitten by the competitive aspect of the game that helps save our environment.

                So here's how the app works. 
                <br><br>
                The first thousand people to download the app will receive an offer to participate in a challenge. 
                They will be explained the rules of the game and asked to pay an entry fee of 100 nok.
                If they were to accept the challenge then they would receive a list of environmental tasks, where they would be required to complete at least one of them within a given timespan in order to win back the entry fee. 
                These tasks have been put together in collaboration with ideal organizations and range from picking up trash at a beach to joining demonstrations or volunteering for a few hours of work at one of our collaborators' venues.  
                <br><br>
                After you've completed one or more tasks, your entry fee will be given back to you and you'll receive one lottery ticket for each task completed.
                Our sponsors have donated a sum of money that makes up the prize money of the lottery along with the entry fee of those who took on the challenge, but failed to complete their assignment in time. 
                Before being eligible to participate in the lottery however, there is one final task that must be completed. You must Jinx ten new people who will then get the offer to take on the challenge.
                Now you decide for yourself whether this is a passive or an active task as you only need to come within proximity of someone else with the app installed to jinx them.  
                <br><br>
                The lottery is held at a seasonal rate, where the size of the pot will vary depending on sponsors and participants. 
                All winners will get to choose a verified environmental organization from a list provided in the app, to which half the earnings will go - the rest will be transferred to the user. 
                This way we ensure that the app provides not only labour for our planet, but also directs money where it counts.
